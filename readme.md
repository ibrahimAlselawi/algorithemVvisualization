- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, play, and adjust the speed of visualization.
- **Custom Inputs**: Test algorithms with your own data.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to help users learn and experiment.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: JavaScript
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - Visualization: Canvas/WebGL
  - Algorithm Implementation: Pure JavaScript

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibrahimAlselawi/algorithemVvisualization.git
   cd algorithemVvisualization
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser directly or use a local server:

   - Using VS Code:
     Install the Live Server extension, right-click on `index.html`, and select "Open with Live Server."

   

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Select an algorithm from the menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, Dijkstra's Algorithm).
3. Input data or use the default data set.
4. Watch the visualization as the algorithm processes the data.
5. Adjust controls such as speed or step-through the algorithm for better understanding.
